# 2D Fighting Game in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This roadmap outlines the steps to design and build a 2D fighting game similar 
to *Street Fighter 2*, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## 1. Conceptualization and Planning

- **Define Game Mechanics**:
  - List all core game mechanics: movement, attacks, defense, combos, health bars, time limits, scoring, rounds, and win conditions.
  - Decide on gameplay features like special moves, power meters, and combo systems.

- **Art Style and Characters**:
  - Outline character designs, animations, and stage backgrounds.
  - Start with two characters with unique move sets, then expand if needed.

- **Control System**:
  - Plan keyboard or touch controls for actions (e.g., left, right, jump, crouch, punch, kick).
  - Define any special key combinations for combos and special moves.

- **Determine Complexity**:
  - Choose the difficulty level and progression mechanics (e.g., AI or two-player mode).

## 2. Setup Project Environment

- **File Structure**:
  - Set up a clean directory structure for scripts, styles, assets, and logic:
    ```
    ├── index.html          # Main game interface
    ├── style.css           # Styling for UI
    ├── main.js             # Core game logic
    ├── assets/             # Images, sprites, sounds
    └── libs/               # External libraries
    ```

- **Canvas Setup**:
  - Add an HTML `<canvas>` element to render characters and backgrounds.
  - Configure the canvas for resolution and scaling to optimize game graphics.

---

## 3. Build the Basic Game Framework

- **HTML and CSS Setup**:
  - Design a basic layout with placeholders for health bars, score, and timer.
  - Use **CSS** to style and position HUD elements and game environment.

- **Initialize Game Loop**:
  - Set up a basic game loop in JavaScript to handle updates and rendering at 60 frames per second.
  - Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations.

---

## 4. Character and Environment Implementation

- **Sprite Creation**:
  - Create sprite sheets for each character’s moves (idle, walk, jump, punch, kick, block).
  - Use frame-based animation for fluidity.

- **Character Animation**:
  - Implement JavaScript functions to manage sprite frames and trigger animations.

- **Background and Stage Design**:
  - Design a static background for the fighting stage.
  - Add simple animations or effects (e.g., waving flags, scrolling clouds) to enhance realism.

---

## 5. Control System and Player Movement

- **Key Bindings**:
  - Implement event listeners in JavaScript to handle keyboard or touchscreen inputs.
  - Map keys to specific actions like `left`, `right`, `jump`, `crouch`, `punch`, `kick`.

- **Player Physics**:
  - Create basic physics for movement, including gravity for jumps and boundary limits.
  - Ensure smooth character transitions and prevent overlapping.

---

## 6. Combat Mechanics

- **Attack and Defense Logic**:
  - Code hit detection using bounding boxes to detect when attacks connect.
  - Implement health reduction logic for successful hits, accounting for different attack types.

- **Combos and Special Moves**:
  - Set up a sequence detection system to recognize special move input combinations.
  - Create unique animations and effects for special moves.

- **Health Bars**:
  - Design and animate health bars to update dynamically as players take damage.
  - Consider adding effects like flashing or color change for low health.

---

## 7. UI Elements and Game Rounds

- **HUD**:
  - Display health bars, timer, and score on the screen.
  - Use **CSS** to style the HUD to match the game’s theme.

- **Round System**:
  - Program a multi-round system, with options like "best of 3" rounds.
  - Display round notifications like "Round 1" and "KO" messages.

- **Timers and Scoring**:
  - Add a countdown timer for each round and end the round if time runs out.
  - Implement a scoring system for multiplayer or potential future modes.

---

## 8. Sound and Music

- **Background Music**:
  - Add looping background music for each stage or character.

- **Sound Effects**:
  - Integrate sound effects for attacks, special moves, round start, KO, etc.
  - Use the audio files (.mp3, .wav) or HTML audio elements for sound management.

---

## 9. Testing and Optimization

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Test the game on different devices and browsers, optimizing sprite rendering and animation as needed.
  
- **Responsive Controls**:
  - Fine-tune the timing and responsiveness of controls to prevent lag.
  
- **Collision Detection**:
  - Optimize hitbox logic to ensure accuracy without excessive computation.

---

## 10. Polish and Final Touches

- **Visual Effects**:
  - Add particle effects like dust for landing, sparks for hits, or trails for special moves.

- **Refine Animations**:
  - Ensure smooth animations and transitions to improve player experience.

- **Difficulty Tuning**:
  - Adjust enemy difficulty (if AI is added) or overall gameplay speed.

- **Bug Fixing**:
  - Address any issues in hit detection, animation glitches, or controls.

---

## 11. Deployment and Post-Launch

- **Deploy the Game**:
  - Host the game on a platform like GitHub Pages for online access.

- **Feedback and Improvements**:
  - Gather player feedback and make adjustments as needed, adding new characters, stages, or difficulty modes over time.

- **Documentation and Code Maintenance**:
  - Document the code and roadmap for future improvements or additional content.
